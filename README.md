Overview
This project visualizes earthquake data using Leaflet.js and the USGS GeoJSON Feed. The visualization includes a dynamic map that plots all the earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude. The size of each marker corresponds to the earthquake's magnitude, and the color reflects the depth. The map also includes popups with detailed information about each earthquake and a legend for context.

Usage
Upon opening the index.html file in a browser, the map will load and display earthquake data for the past month. Each marker on the map corresponds to an earthquake, with size based on magnitude and color based on depth.

Interacting with the Map:
Click on any marker to see details about the earthquake, including its magnitude, location, and depth.
Use the legend in the bottom-right corner to understand the color coding based on depth.
Features
Real-time visualization of earthquake data.
Markers that dynamically change size based on earthquake magnitude.
Color-coded depth representation.
Interactive popups displaying detailed information about each earthquake.
Legend providing context for depth levels.
